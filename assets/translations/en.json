    "content": "When the letter **Nun mati ن** or **Tanwin ٌ ٍ ً** meets one of the following 15 letters: `ت ث ج د ذ ز س ش ص ض ط ظ ف ق ك`.\n\nThe rule for Ikhfa is to replace the silent nun or tanwin with a sound between idgham and izhar, which is nasalized with a soft sound and held for about 2 harakats before clearly pronouncing the `Ikhfa` letter that follows.\n\nIkhfa is divided into 3 parts:\n1. **Ikhfa Aqrob** is the nearest Ikhfa, so the NG sound is slightly less clear. Example: `di`.\n2. **Ikhfa Ausath** is the middle Ikhfa, so the NG sound is moderate. Example: `ni`.\n3. **Ikhfa Ab'ad** is the farthest Ikhfa, so the NG sound is clear, such as the letters `di` and `du`."

  "qalqalahExplanation": {
    "content": "When one of these 5 letters (`ب د ج ط ق`) meets `sukun` (`ـْـ`).\n\nThe rule for Qalqalah is to emphasize the `sukun` (`ـْـ`) when pronouncing the letter. This can be divided into:\n- **Qalqalah Sughra** (Small Qalqalah), with lighter emphasis.\n- **Qalqalah Kubra** (Major Qalqalah), with stronger emphasis.\n- **Qalqalah Akbar** (Greatest Qalqalah), with the strongest emphasis.\n- This occurs within a verse and chapter."
